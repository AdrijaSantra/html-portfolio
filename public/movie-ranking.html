<h1>MOVIE LIST</h1>
<h2>List of movies I've watched recently</h2> 
<hr />

<h3>1.The cat returns</h3>
<p>This could potentially become my comfort movie cuz of its light theme and animated nature</p>

<h3>2.Kiki's delivery service</h3>
<p>This movie is again a ghibli studio movie that follows a witch and her cat as the witch comes of age and moves to city to start an independent life. Honestly just want to watch it for jiji again</p>

<h3>3.Aquamarine</h3>
<p>It's one of those typical non-sense hollywood movie. It's okay for a one time watch I wouldn't watch it again tho.</p>
